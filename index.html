    <h2>The vision of Moon Colonization</h2>
    <div>
      <p class="words">The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits at an average distance of 384,400 km
        (238,900 mi), about 30 times Earth's diameter. The Moon always presents the same side to Earth, because
        gravitational pull has locked its rotation to the planet. This results in the lunar day of 29.5 Earth days
        matching the lunar month. The Moon's gravitational pull – and to a lesser extent the Sun's – are the main
        drivers of the tides.

        The Moon is in geophysical terms a planetary-mass object or satellite planet. It has a mass that amounts to 1.2%
        of Earth's, and a diameter that is roughly one-quarter of Earth's or with 3,474 km (2,159 mi) about as wide as
        Australia.[17] Within the Solar System it is the most massive and largest satellite in relation to its parent
        planet, the fifth most massive and largest moon overall, and more massive and larger than all known dwarf
        planets.[18] Its surface gravity is about one sixth of Earth's, about half of that of Mars, and after Jupiter's
        moon Io the second highest among all Solar System moons. The body of the Moon is differentiated and terrestrial,
        with no significant hydrosphere, atmosphere, or magnetic field. It formed 4.51 billion years ago, not long after
        Earth's formation, out of the debris from a giant impact between Earth and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called
        Theia.

        <br><br>The lunar surface is covered in lunar dust and marked by mountains, impact craters, their ejecta,
        ray-like streaks and, mostly on the near side of the Moon, by dark maria ("seas"), which are plains of cooled
        magma. These maria were formed when molten lava flowed into ancient impact basins. The Moon is, beside when
        passing through Earth's shadow during a lunar eclipse, always illuminated by the Sun, but from Earth the visible
        illumination shifts during its orbit, producing the lunar phases.[19] The Moon is the brightest celestial object
        in Earth's night sky. This is mainly due to its large angular diameter, while the reflectance of the lunar
        surface is comparable to that of asphalt. The apparent size is nearly the same as that of the Sun, allowing it
        to cover the Sun almost completely during a total solar eclipse. From Earth about 59% of the lunar surface is
        visible over time due to cyclical shifts in perspective (libration), making parts of the far side of the Moon
        visible.

        For humans the Moon has been an important source of inspiration and knowledge, having been crucial to
        cosmography, mythology, religion, art, time keeping, natural science, and spaceflight. On September 13, 1959,
        the first human-made object to reach an extraterrestrial body arrived on the Moon, the Soviet Union's Luna 2
        impactor. In 1966 the Moon became the first extraterrestrial body where soft landings and orbital insertions
        were achieved. On July 20, 1969, humans for the first time landed on the Moon and any extraterrestrial body, at
        Mare Tranquillitatis with the lander Eagle of the United States' Apollo 11 mission. Five more crews were sent
        between then and 1972, each with two men landing on the surface. The longest stay was 75 hours by the Apollo 17
        crew. Thereafter exploration of the Moon has continued robotically, with crewed missions being planned to return
        starting in the late 2020s.

        The usual English proper name for Earth's natural satellite is simply Moon, with a capital M.[20][21] The noun
        moon is derived from Old English mōna, which (like all its Germanic cognates) stems from Proto-Germanic
        *mēnōn,[22] which in turn comes from Proto-Indo-European *mēnsis "month"[23] (from earlier *mēnōt, genitive
        *mēneses) which may be related to the verb "measure" (of time).[24]

        Occasionally, the name Luna /ˈluːnə/ is used in scientific writing[25] and especially in science fiction to
        distinguish the Earth's moon from others, while in poetry "Luna" has been used to denote personification of the
        Moon.[26] Cynthia /ˈsɪnθiə/ is another poetic name, though rare, for the Moon personified as a goddess,[27]
        while Selene /səˈliːniː/ (literally "Moon") is the Greek goddess of the Moon.

        <br><br>The English adjective pertaining to the Moon is "lunar", derived from the Latin word for the Moon, lūna.
        Selenian /səliːniən/[28] is an adjective used to describe the Moon as a world, rather than as a celestial
        object,[29] but its use is rare. It is derived from σελήνη selēnē, the Greek word for the Moon, and its cognate
        selenic was originally a rare synonym[30] but now nearly always refers to the chemical element selenium.[31] The
        element name selenium and the prefix seleno- (as in selenography, the study of the physical features of the
        Moon) come from this Greek word.[32][33]

        The Greek goddess of the wilderness and the hunt, Artemis, equated with the Roman Diana, one of whose symbols
        was the Moon and who was often regarded as the goddess of the Moon, was also called Cynthia, from her legendary
        birthplace on Mount Cynthus.[34] These names – Luna, Cynthia and Selene – are reflected in technical terms for
        lunar orbits such as apolune, pericynthion and selenocentric.

        The astronomical symbol for the Moon is a crescent, ☾, for example in M☾ 'lunar mass' (also ML).

        <h2>10 Facts about Moon</h2>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>1. The Moon began with an explosive collision <br>
        <br>

        <i>“The prevailing idea is that the Moon was formed in a violent event between the proto-Earth – an early-stage
          Earth that was much bigger than it is today – and an object (labelled ‘Theia’) about the size of Mars,”
          explains Robert Massey, deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society. “Debris was ejected into
          space and then coalesced to form the Moon.” Modern research seems to confirm the Moon is made of material from
          the early Earth’s crust. Dubbed the ‘Giant Impact Hypothesis,’ this collision is believed to have happened 4.5
          billion years ago and would have been 100 million times larger than the event which wiped out the dinosaurs.
        </i>

        <br><br><br>2. It used to look much bigger<br><br>

        <i>“The Moon started out around ten times closer to the Earth than it is now,” reveals Massey. “Imagine looking
          up at the night sky and seeing the Moon 10 times bigger.” Computer simulations suggest the Moon could even
          have been 12-19 times closer, at a distance of just 20,000-30,000km, compared to 384,000km today. And it is
          still spinning away. “Because of a transfer of energy from the rotation and tidal bulges of the Earth, the
          Moon gets 3.78cm further away each year.” That’s roughly the same rate at which your fingernails grow.</i>
      </p>
      <br>
      <div id=space-img><img src="space-1.jpg"></div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>3. Moon dust smells like gunpowder
        <br><br>
        <i>“There is a lot dust on the surface of the Moon and the Apollo astronauts found their suits covered in it
          when they climbed into their lunar modules,” explains Massey. “One astronaut on the Apollo 17 mission
          (Harrison ‘Jack’ Schmitt) likened its smell to that of gunpowder. The dust caused some astronauts a kind of
          ‘lunar hay fever.’” The sneezing and congestion took days to disappear. “The good thing is there is no wind to
          blow it about,” adds Massey.</i><br><br>

        <br> 4. Surface temperatures reach boiling point <br><br>

        <i>“Because the Moon has no protective atmosphere, the surface experiences extreme temperatures, from incredibly
          cold on the far ‘night’ side and above boiling on the ‘sunny’ near side,” explains Massey. According to NASA,
          the Moon’s temperature can span from 123 degrees Celsius to -233 degrees Celsius. Its mean surface temperature
          is 107 degrees Celsius in the day and -153 degrees Celsius at night.</i>
      </p><br>

      <div id="space-img"><img src="space-2.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <p> 5. Those craters can unlock space history<br><br>

        <i>“Without an atmosphere, the Moon is not protected from meteorites, so it is full of craters which really help
          us to explore the ‘natural history’ of our Solar System,” says Massey. There are 190 identified impact craters
          on Earth, with many covered by water and vegetation, but there are millions on the Moon – including 5000
          larger than 20km in diameter. “Because the surface of the Moon is dormant and it experiences fewer geological
          forces (like volcanoes or erosion) than Earth, it neatly stores pristine evidence of ancient formations and
          craters. That makes it a brilliant laboratory or archive to help understand our Solar System.”</i>

      </div>

      <p>6. You always see the same side of the Moon<br><br>

        <i>Just like Earth, the Moon rotates around its axis, but because that rotation lasts about 27 days – roughly
          the same as the 27.32 days the Moon takes to orbit the Earth – you only ever see one face of the Moon. “This
          phenomenon is called ‘tidal locking’ or ‘captured rotation’ and it means the other side of the Moon was
          completely invisible before the Space Age,” says Massey. “Whereas the near side has lunar maria – large, dark
          plains which often cover impact basins – the far side is more cratered and rugged, with a thicker crust and
          less evidence of volcanic activity.”</i>

      <br><br>
      <div id="space-img3"><img src="space-3.jpg"></div>

      <p>7. The Moon causes tidal bulges<br><br>
        <i>

          “Put simply, tides on Earth are the result of bulges in the water caused by the gravitational forces of the
          Moon,” says Massey. “Essentially the Moon pulls up water on one side of the Earth, but on the other side,
          where its gravitational forces are weaker, the water bulges in the opposite direction.” Those bulges move
          around the oceans as the Earth rotates, causing high and low tides around the globe. “Because tides are also
          influenced by gravity from the sun, without the moon we would still have tides but they would be smaller.”</i>
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p>8. Scientists have discovered Moon water <br><br>
        <i>“India’s Chandrayaan-1 mission discovered water close to the poles of the Moon and NASA has found water in
          the soil,” says Massey. “It’s not much – for one cubic metre of soil you might extract a litre - but it
          increases the possibility of one day building bases on the Moon.”</i>
      </p>
      <br>
      <div id="space-img"><img src="space-4.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <br><br>
      <p>9. A lunar eclipse saved Christopher Columbus<br><br>

        <br><i>“The Nebra Sky Disc, a bronze artefact dating to 1600BC which was discovered in Germany, is the first
          known human map to include an image of the Moon - and it is a reminder of how much the Moon has influenced
          human history,” says Massey. “The Moon even saved the explorer Christopher Columbus from starvation.” After
          consulting his almanac, Columbus used the lunar eclipse of February 29, 1504, to frighten the native Arawak
          Indians on the island of Jamaica into giving him and his crew food. According to his son Ferdinand, at the
          sight of the eclipse the Arawaks “with great howling and lamentation came running from every direction to the
          ships laden with provisions.”

        </i>
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>10. Lunar bases are on the horizon<br><br>

        <i>“Although we are centuries off large numbers of people living on the Moon, it is possible we could soon have
          scientific bases there, similar to Antarctic research stations,” explains Massey. NASA is hoping to return
          astronauts to the Moon by the late 2020s. “Planetary scientists believe a base could have lots of uses, from
          improving the search for organic material to establishing a radio telescope which would be shielded from the
          Earth to better listen for extra-terrestrial signals. The Moon’s surface area is as big as Europe and Africa
          combined so we have only scratched the surface.”
